## Logistic Regession Model

$$
Y_{ij} \stackrel{iid}{\sim} Binomial(M_{ij}, \theta_{ij})
$$
$\theta_{ij}$ is the home run rate for player i in year j

$$
log(\frac{\theta_{ij}}{1- \theta_{ij}}) = \boldsymbol\alpha R_{ij} + \boldsymbol\beta B_{ij} + f(A_{ij}, R_{ij})
$$

$f(A_{ij}, R_{ij})$ is a smoothing function for age based on position, we used cubic B-splines with coefficients $\gamma$ for each position.

$$
\boldsymbol\alpha = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            \boldsymbol\alpha_o & \quad E_{ij}= 0 \\
            \boldsymbol\alpha_1 & \quad E_{ij} = 1
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$

where $\alpha_{ko} < \alpha_{k1}$, $k=1,..9$

$E_{ij}$ is an indicator variable for whether player i is determined to be
an elite in year j, this is redetermined each year.

## Elite Indicator

![Elite Status](C:\Users\Daveed\Desktop\School\Fall2019\STAT610\Project\Elite.png)



## Priors

Position Intercepts:
$$
\alpha_k \sim MVN(\boldsymbol0, \tau^2\boldsymbol I_2)* I(\alpha_{ko} < \alpha_{k1}), k = 1,...,9
$$

Home Ball Park / Team Intercepts:
$$
\boldsymbol\beta \sim MVN(0, \tau^2\boldsymbol I)
$$

Spline Coefficients:
$$
\gamma_{kp} \sim Normal(0, \tau^2), k=1,..,9 ; p = 1,2,3,4
$$

## MCMC Implementation


## Future Work

- Add age as a factor for $E_{ij}$, as players age they are less likely to
maintain elite status
- Model with a multinomial response to include more than just home
runs. Include things like on base percentage, doubles, singles
